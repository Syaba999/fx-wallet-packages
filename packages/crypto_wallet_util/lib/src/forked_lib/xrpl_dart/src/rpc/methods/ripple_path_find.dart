/// The ripple_path_find method is a simplified version of the
/// path_find method that provides a single response with a payment
/// path you can use right away. It is available in both the WebSocket
/// and JSON-RPC APIs. However, the results tend to become outdated as
/// time passes. Instead of making multiple calls to stay updated, you
/// should instead use the path_find method to subscribe to continued
/// updates where possible.

/// Although the rippled server tries to find the cheapest path or
/// combination of paths for making a payment, it is not guaranteed that
/// the paths returned by this method are, in fact, the best paths.
