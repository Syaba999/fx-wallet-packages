/// Tip: The AMMWithdraw transaction automatically tries to delete an AMM, along with
/// associated ledger entries such as empty trust lines, if it withdrew all the assets
/// from the AMM's pool. However, if there are too many trust lines to the AMM account
/// to remove in one transaction, it may stop before fully removing the AMM. Similarly,
/// an AMMDelete transaction removes up to a maximum number of trust lines; in extreme
/// cases, it may take several AMMDelete transactions to fully delete the trust lines
/// and the associated AMM. In all cases, the AMM ledger entry and AMM account are
/// deleted by the last such transaction.
